a.	Add SKUs: the company needs to set their SKUs, if they are selling in crate, units, cartons etc. You can add as many categories available in your company.

b.	Add Inventory: Once SKUs are set, the admin can add the list of item available for selling on the platform.

d.	Assign Inventory: At the begin of each month or set time, the admin needs to assign certain quantity of item in inventory to each sales rep. The sale representative doesn’t get to sell all all the item in inventory except the ones assigned to him.
